Njobvu-AI is an open-source tool for collaborative image labeling and implementation of computer vision algorithms. Njobvu-AI leverages the neural network frameworks YOLO and Tensorflow to enable in-house computer vision model training and image classification.

Users can annotate images with bounding boxes, use these datasets to train custom models, and apply these models to new images for classification. The validation mode allows users to review and correct model predictions and download data in various formats. Njobvu-AI can be run on both desktop and server hardware using Node.js, allowing users to collaborate on data labeling and image review locally or online.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Server Configuration:**
======================================================================================================================

**Cloud Usage**
You can host Njobvu-AI on the cloud to enable users to access it via the internet.

1) Within the Njobvu-AI directory navigate to `/controllers/training/config`
2) Open the file *config.json*
3) Fill the parameters with a specific port, and hostname.
4) If your connection is secure, fill the parameters with the location of your sites SSL key and ceritification. Also add this line to the options variable in server.js:   host: '*your hostname here*'  
5) Run `node server.js`
6) (Optional) It is reccomended to use a program like `screen` to keep your server running uninterrupted on the host machine
